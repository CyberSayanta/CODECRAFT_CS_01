# 🛡️ Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation

## 🔖 Task - 01: Implement Caesar Cipher

Welcome to **Code Craft's** first challenge – the **Caesar Cipher** project!  
This repository contains a simple Python program that allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** text using the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm.

---

## 📜 What is Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest known encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters of a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

For example:
- Original: `HELLO`
- Shift: `3`
- Encrypted: `KHOOR`

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Encrypts messages with a user-defined shift
- ✅ Decrypts messages using the same shift value
- ✅ Supports both upper and lower case letters
- ✅ Ignores non-alphabetic characters (like punctuation or digits)

---

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/CyberSayanta/CODECRAFT_CS_01.git

2. Run the program
python caesar_cipher.py

3. Follow the prompts to enter a message and a shift value.
   Example-
   Enter E to encrypt or D to decrypt: E
Enter your message: Hello World!
Enter shift value: 3
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog!
